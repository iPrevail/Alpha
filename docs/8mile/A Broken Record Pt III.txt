Song Title - A Broken Record Pt III
look i don't expect much well I believe that as far as i can throw it, smash bros, no hoes, stippers with nice tits like big tits,
so an astronaught sorry about the spelling, my english is shitty like birdman, no disc inserted, no more games, no more bullshit,
honey with boiled noodles, better then spagetti, I am not sure to be honest I love both, ja rule can eat the meatballs, choke on that bitch mc,
wtf is seriously going on has he crossed that bridge again, did you burn it, did you support it, no blank canvas can be like a blank vision,
only hope and faith you will survive, I hate english, forgiveness is in that empty jar under your bed, who am I to dictate you,
[Soldiers Marching]
at the end it is just gonna be you, sure there is people that will visit you right?, someday that might just change who will ever know,
if you saw things the way I do would you judge, would you distroy another life, I hope I have not, only god can judge so Mathers showtime,
no camaras, no papers, no pens, no computers, nothing but yourself, yeah D12 Ft YelaWolf, nice beat, and shit like birdman, I will never reach,
for something I can not get like oxygen right? maybe but imagine your on a beach,
with your friends might be limited but who cares still having fun with the snow,
i mean sand right, somtimes lame jokes will keep someone alive, give it a try, just remember your wearing a clown suit just like the next soldier,
no disrepect ment, finally a eminem concert I wonder would iPrevail tag along?, 
like I prevail you to be you never change unless life has a way of screwing you over,
yeah I am white but I really wanna be tanned like you know enough to fit in somewhere or to belong,
LP bacon and cheese, vodka and fruit, missunderstood like everybody else, tell your fortune cookie to be nice,
oh hell no!, hell froze again, Freeze has been here before can't you tell, look remember life can sometimes be karma itself,
you made it, how does it feel, are you ok, should i care, only if you do i guess you know what I mean right, no spagetti,
like no strings attached, no tempon situations unless it is shark week, eww oh well be said it guess it can not be undone,
I hate my life seriously I don't know why, but that is just how it truly is i guess, no contact no lightbulb no way out,
Am I worth listening too, I honestly don't care for some reason but it does float in Skylar Grey Clouds, nice verse, no one got hurt,
I am sorry what more can I say,
this is not my last beat or verse put that in reverse did he just say LimpBizkit is busy getting Brittney Spears to drop to her knees,
vanilla and cheese,

Thank You!
