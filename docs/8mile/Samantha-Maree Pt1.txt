Song Title - Limted Edition
[intro beat]
Hello my beautiful daughter,
[stage is empty]
I am standing here in north michigan, wishing you were here, looking at me,
but I am here all alone, wishing again, throwing unwanted money into a wishing well, because I honestly care about you,
I wish you all the best my little mockingbird, yes that is correct, I did it again, made you another song to vibe too,
do you feel loved yet, or is this another dream of dads again. hello are you there Samantha-Maree?, I want to cuddle you,
I want to kiss you on that forehead of yours, I want to just simply say I love you with every breathe I am taking, look in the mirror,
do you see your wonderland yet?, if not look into your mothers eyes, you will find it there hopefully, is this good enough,
Am I soldier yet?, am I strong enough?, am I the dad you always wanted?, I don't know but I am gonna try anyway, so just hop into your bed,
fluff up a few pillows on your bed, get all comfy like Hilary Duff would be, tell Taylor Swift I say hello again, can you just do me a favour and thank your mum,
I know she loves just as much as I do, if not even more, I honestly don't got a clue,  but here I am trying for you, if I could rewind to the day you were born,
I would do just that with some of the present to come back with like my happiness, it is not your fault darling, dad is just a psychopath, yes I admit, I am crazy,
but I love you my sweetheart, don't cry it is all gonna be ok, chin up, look at the future, paint your picture, smile even though somedays you wanna cry, it is ok I 
cry on an empty stage or inside my barely furnished unit, when I see pictures of you apart of me breaks down, but then I hear your voice telling me to keep marching on,
I'll do just that for you, anything my darling, what do you like sting rays and butterflies or sting rays and dolphins?, only time will tell wont it,

Just put on those beats headphones, listen to the words and beat, hopefully it inspires you to continue on with life,
vanilla ice he is a nice guy, you should try to send him a letter to thank him because without him daddy wouldn't be a write a single of lyrics,
his name ryhmes with so many things like I love Samantha-Maree, cheese cake, sweetheart, look at you being a tough cookie, please don't crumble if you do just ask for Eminem,
he will be there to save you, he is just simply our superman, our lyrical god, our super hero with words, never give up, never freestyle without a dinosaur by your side, that's nice,
I made you think twice and you just blinked and agreed without even saying yes, I love you darling you are my world, my universe, my ocean, my hero, my beautiful daughter,
I'll always be a star in the sky watching over you, this is just your lullaby, good night, I do miss and love you, sleep tight and don't let the monsters scare you, when your scared
and in the dark just think of a special location, for me I think about a beach filled with tigers and people, kiss kiss sweetheart, good luck,

Love,
The Insane Father.
