Song Title - The Strugles Right?
these voices never go away is that a good sign?, does it really matter? does math matter? does anything matter to you anymore?,
something should hopefully, this is no joke, i truly wish it was but that is just how it is for this idea to work i guess, i suggest, i have no damn clue,
ice-cream & igloos, no shoelaces, no understanding, no real knowledge, this asylum, coke and nelly,

i wanna be sober meaning no drinking, just being high and hoping tomorrow is a better day, no idea seriously just crispy cream donuts, go nuts, go ahead,
be willing to do something different, though JD with Yelawolf would be nice, I guess, this is just a dream, hello world?,

Insanity is on the list, like spagetti, no padded shoulders, no bullproof vest, just me, as real as it can get? I am not sure I even believe that, so let's see,
no fame, no money, but I got a wife, it's nice, relax it can be anything like that idea just before, 
having somethings is nice but having nothing sometimes just feels right,
I just need your help do you understand now?, hopefully this is not to painful to actually rap, am i good enough?, I don't think so, but sometimes I do, it's
confusing, do you understand yet?, I hope not but one day you will, have you ever just felt so much pain that it once made you angry?,
I do it kinda almost killed me, no this and that, no me, I wonder do they care, shit not them facking puke effects like a asian spelt right? 
tech n9ne ( echo x3 )
[Tech n9ne] - speedom like boredom.
shit I am stuck on what to even say, dinosaurs, peter pan, not a fan, oh well tell someone that cares right?, 
sorry i stopped to have a think about what next to say,
this list is like the santa list I guess, merry christmas, wait hold up it is only February, relax it is snowing somewhere right?, 
did you bring the deadly viper and the light? good let's just simply rko our situation and move forward, sorry I did a typo had to patch it up,
yeah I understand you got your world and I have mine, do they collide or do they match up? am I good enough? does this equation make any sense?,
earthquake like a earthly whale, wait hold up, did you just compare a earthquake with a whale?, man your a try hard, yeah i know i try hard to fit in,
I don't care even inside a shoebox without a shoelace, no excuse, no bullshit, no nazi cult, no war, like that is gonna happen, oh wishful thinking,
if I was god there would be another planet just like Pluto, not ashamed just would like a place to call home, no telephones, no internet, just a note pad and pen, Benjamin,
that is never gonna happen life is not like that and we all know that it even said it in the book of knowledge, nod your head, stand up, fight, but no bullets,
karma is a bitch so switch over to lil wayne insane station, no train station, so make it,

8mile is waiting, slowpokes are ok i guess, do you understand, look we are both slow at something, like I am so slow I just happen to eat the alarm system,
as I was putting on my thinking cap you know that one that makes you feel smart, yeah DC or Unit? both do the job, hahaha, this mother fucker is giggling,
he doesn't know the difference between wine and the time, no time to rewind, step up did you feel any pain as you listen or even read,
I am sure I did but you know feelings are a bitch, we all hate to admit it but somewhere is inside this temple of Pluto you must feel something other then hate,
I mean I hate myself so your bound to do the same, i wish i was joking right about now, funk brothers, no brothers, no life outside those padded walls,
no life line, no fishing line, no shoelaces, no just simply no, how can we live this way? don't you feel the need to do something right? I am only trying,
I guess it is a start, not a finish line right?, oh did you already finish before me? I don't mind this mother fucking turtle will catch and that rabbit, are you a universal soldier yet?,
hopefully you believed something I have said, if i truly hated you I would have done it with saying, speaking, thinking, impossible right?
they say anything is possible, so can you change the world? even I tried with you?, 
knowledge is nothing like power having both means you have responsablities remember that if that is what you wanted,
fred is a curse like limptbizkit, no timtams, no cd diss yet, hola, freestyle, I'll snore while you figure out your plan,
make it simple and you can make it just don't break it, you will live with regret, no feeling like that is needed inside your mind or life, no rythms,
i can not fucking spell it pisses me off, 

I will never be a Eminem or a star tonight but i will try to do my utter best to show you I care, treat you with some sort of respect let it be truths,
the ball is in your tennis court, just remember I don't have a tennis racket,
just myself, worthless but worth something, no captal wage, no life outside a shoebox,
do you understand this is just how it is bottom line, no sinker though, no titantic, 
what do you have other then yourself, what can you just do to never get to that path in life, you know die, like what is your last words, 
i got a mental white padded wall with just one window of hope, no rope, no shoelace, no lil wayne crying over a dead bird, holy shit like no shit,
tennis courts, batman fans, I just want Universal Soldiers, I spelt that in english right?,

water is dripping like a horror movie like being gased by hitler but it just turns out to be a fart from the undertaker, no more Nazi cults, no this is confusing,
I need you do something prevail in life, be strong, be yourself, come on i know you understand that knowledge, hinder,
forgive those that may have done wrong, sometimes I know it is hard thing to do, i fully understand, u232,
snort that line of doubt, that line inside your swimming pool, I know this is all for entertainment but damn why so serious?, sometimes it is nice to express,
even though I hate it personally, because you would need my eye balls to see how I seen life, freestyle,
get a life off the street, it is simple really, pay it forward, be kind, respect to those that understand it's true meaning,
 2pac & Notorious Mc3 was somewhere here,
 nothing like mc square though so chill,
 welcome to the mentally ill ebook club where you get be a client, no meds, no ropes, no pokemon, damn!
 how I am supose to catch AIDS, this is just a joke, I am not like hitler, more like Shindler, I guess, I am new to this,
 have a good life,
 bye.
