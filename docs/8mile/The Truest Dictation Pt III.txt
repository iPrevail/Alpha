Song Title - The Truest Dictation Pt III

All Hail Marshall Bruce Mathers III life without courage is simply not possible?, 
Sorry I am not even sure if that is how you spell, rewind that alice in wonderland clock,
tick tock there they go again, talking shit they know nothing about like Lil Wayne,
I am not snoring, I am just simply having alook inside a package which we all seem to call knowledge, Noddy was busy driving around,
no speeding though, so back down, freeze this very moment,

I enjoy freestyling because it makes me feel like a man inside of a space outfit, look around don't you see Pluto,
Mc3 is nothing like mc square, vanilla ice, ice cream, a whole new life,
look at those dices rollin along like your life was designed to break you down, chin up, look around do you see a new light?,
I bet every cent that your life could change if you just put your life on the line like a fishing line, catch a new lifestyle, dinosaur,
I am sorry I even exist but here we stand on this platform, harry potter is a stoner look at him, don't judge before you walked that path,
what needs to change?, me or you?, seriously I am unsure, spagetti and vodka, shaken not stirred right? I honestly don't know anymore,
serial killer is on the lose with your head but nobody cares, I understand, move forwards, pay it forward, be nice like vanilla, Faith,
yes I belive in some sorta God & Goddess? right? did I write that correctly for the white house, who cares just spam Mc Duck, this is pretty cool,
is this even getting across, did you cross that 8mile yet?, dinosaur, alice was once in your wonderland, who cares not even batman, look out another light,
fourtwenty is a nice 2pac & Notorious B.I.G was around looking for another soldier, yes you? don't even look around, I am talking to you, sweet another diner meal,
no wagonwheels, no timtams, no vanilla ice-cream, you gotta do something, what can you do to fix this?, I can not tell you where to go in life, just try to be you,
no shady shit either or D12 will turn into a DurtyCarton with an asian and elton john as the gay mascot, he is very proud indeed, look around, he or she could be bi-cycle,
like no ice cream in your fridge, tick tock I broke the clock again, the shehulk is inside me, it scares you and your nightmares, Bruce calm down, Cait right? no dr.dre,
Hannibal Lector is in the house with Jack The Ripper, no smoke, no lil wayne, no situations, no birdman for life, 
who is gonna pay wayne? not that birdwoman oh shit like birdshit birdman with breast, holla if you have gotten those things oh wait,
tick tock he has no cock, birdshimmy, has not got any money because another bird took it, better catch that dove, get a real job,
picture that birdman getting shat on by his own kind? no racial remark ment this is suppose to be a harmless joke, freestyle, Blowfish, Cypher.

You got it!
