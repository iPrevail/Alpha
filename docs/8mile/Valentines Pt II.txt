Song Title - Valentines Pt II
them people that misunderstand life is a roller coaster, hold on as you land on Pluto,
this space subject I mean straight jacket within these padded white walls, oh I am so happy now,
chin up, keep marching along, so move along, never give up just not yet anyways, are you ready?,
nope ok good me neither, baby steps an you will get there if you wanna take a human chance on them dice you hold in your hand,
then let go and hopefully you made the correct choice, no vanilla ice, 2pac & church, damn!, 
this heart attack has changed me into a person that honestly cares and wants to see this through,
no more heart ache, no more pain just simply numb like MuddVayne, so get back up and fix this some how, 
[skylar grey] - I don't know something I guess.
now you have figured that,
you can do as you please like go to the beach or join the army, take a bullet for your country,
me i'll just simply matrix this shit so I can figure out the new life path I have been given, fresh oxygen,
[YelaWolf] - Keep The Howling Down.
never miss that window of chance as you might lose everything you ever felt or wanted, 
I got no clue as yet what it means to freestyle, 
[Joel Turner] - Smash Them!
or does it mean this?,
[Slim Shady] - Time for there rim job because they couldn't get a real job, 
just continue flipin' burgers or running along the beach at night, sometimes you just simply take a chance,
it can either make you or break you down like how you feel life was designed, I hope this is getting through to you,
I did put it in english right? or is this just another computer language? freestylin' like a dinosaur, tick tock this is never gonna stop,
give up that is your choice or just believe in whatever it is that makes you better about yourself, I seriously got no idea yet what to freestyle about,
expressions are like a train wreck, like bullets flying everywhere, like world war I, did it, to be different, not like you, i hope people understand that,
smack a bitch in a winecellar doesn't sound right does it? no Captain Crunch, no he wouldn't do that, easy because he is no chris brown, all jokes side now,
are you a cow or a dinosaur, doesn't even make sense but here we are thinking about it all, what is next? Goldberg?, The Undertaker, The Game Triple H, 
nope ok what about the Dr of basic thuganomics, no comics, no gimics, look closely did you see it, Degenation X, Chyna,
oh you didn't know freestyle with me one day, or you better call Mr.Asshole because only you 2 will care, not us at all,
selfish right, kinda but that is life I guess when you got a pet dinosaur under your bed, with jars of hope, and hopefully understanding,
lord give them strength, sometimes when I fall down that alice in wonderland I never want to get back up but alice once told me she lived next door,
that is a messy verse, this better not be a curse, this better not be a twilight situation or high school musical, seriously wow some people,
do they even care? apart of me does care about something like that, never know might be a very handy tool in life to master like pokemon,
no master ballz, no dragon ballz, no way to catch slowpoke syndrome, nutty professor, what's up doc?,
[John Cena] - WordLife? Right?
I got no chance or pocket change to even get through this love shit I mean love ship, yep, ok that is akward,
snow is your domain, make something other then just jack the ripper, no stripper, no beer, no bet, no regret, 
design your paradice like a parasite, no head lice, no asian rice, no chow kitten, look at you with your chop sticks eating raw dinosaur,

no future, no plan, just going with the flow of whatever i guess I am not even sure where I am heading on this 8mile adventure,
all i know is i just wanna fit in, not be a cocky snob from the unkown parts of the universe paths, no light just an idea,

Universal Soldiers, Goldberg,
Thank You,
I just wanna be accepted. church is the word not bird is the word.
