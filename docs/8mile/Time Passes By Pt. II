Song Title - Time Passes By Pt. II
so little hype i wonder sometimes is it worth it, I honestly am not sure but I will give it a try, attempt, murder your wife, no be nice,
no need for voilence right?, no skylar grey clouds today, how unfortant, chin up you will get through that mosh situation, life experience,
I just can picture an army flying over your country, state, last meal today, you know what I mean, it can only go so far before we hit the butterfly effect,
no more chances, no more doubt, no more bullshit, George W Bush couldn't even find Donald Duck don't you mean McDucking yeah confusing, get a light bulb,
hinder fans don't do it, you could lose everything, it is not nice, I am not gonna dictate your life but life is a roller coaster and some people are just who
they are, somehoe you can help right?

Yeah I feel like I am recruiting for some war, not yet but one day when I am not colour blind, simple minded, with a sniper looking out for you,
under cover as a serial killer, mad scientist, no more remorse, no feelings, numb all over again, your wife better be dead because shady needs to fill
his tags up, crocodile dundee, no bigger knife then life, I will never match up to the big leagues, so I will just keep trying, who am I hurting, myself and you,
he said, she said bullshit, like a banana split, sylar was here once, yeah thanks for the cheerleader, if she didn't exist dreams would not get fulfilled,
onion spray this holy race, feel some pain, live a dream, don't stress about money, enjoy life, you only honestly get one, sometimes more then one if lucky,
don't risk it, like limptbizkit, smack a bitch in a winecellar, you will get there,

murder me, bitch please murder yourself, you caused the issues, I just finished them, 
with a pen and paper, no sweat, no just go do it, nike airs like an esky filled with beer and ice,
no this is sober me, well sorta you will learn as time goes by this is just how it is, I believe I can not fly or even jump because I am just a white man,
no fans just loyal soldiers, we are all clowns eventually, dinosaurs, your doors open, your window of change is half open, what you gonna do,
I am gonna call the ghost busters, no chest hairs, only a fan not a solid 10, cartoons and a swimming pool, inline hockey, freestyler, asians without rice,
oh no what are we gonna do, find the pandas they will know what to do, snorlax is the ring leader, lazy sod, nah nice try,

I am tied up like mentally and well I just don't know, why does a dinosaur become your pet, why did Eminem exist? why was I even born, dragon born,
i hope you like that joke, that line, that verse, that only curse, gee it hurts to much english need to back away into my shoebox and find a nice corner,
oh lookie a rat name ratatoii sorry shit spelling, what are we gonna do, what am I gonna do, I still have no clue, can this be a new beginning, let's just see,
marmalade situation nice and sticky, pieces of orange, a couple of more mouth fulls and you can be a reviewer on instagram, 
mc3 is here to stay wether you like it or not, don't choke again, make sure to ask your dead wife how life is looking, no breast milk, no more wifes, might as 
well end your life, right, that is insane, but we understand the corpal punishment is not required president Dwayne, am I ever gonna fit into this universe,
hopeless, i'll never know, no bright lights, no uncle fester, no time to admit your failures, something good is gonna happen one day, where life has just changed,
thank yourself not a mexican wife, this crew could take down 9/11 yeah make the world anti-war, save a bullet for another day, left right left, no more tennis shoes,
no more respect, whats the point, I don't know but we have gotta try, I have I changed since my brothers death, most likely hopefully it is good enough,
no gay disputes, no bullshit, no drama, just life at it's fullest,
do you understand you could simply fail this mission but deep down I am sure you can kill my doubts,
don't beat your wife or your children, no one likes a lowrider anyway, over rated drama, no nice endings, failures,
get up you can do it 20 plus push ups, then some chin ups, keep marching along to that beat, no space cake yet, no birthday wish is fulfilled,
change it all if you want, be a ford thinker, laughing out loud, I mean be a person that is holden onto this life, with a tight rope without any shoelaces,
no gold, no bullets, no riffles, just a wife to look after,
I don't need a fancy life to be happy but sometimes a holiday would be nice, you know fly around and catch a firefox, instead of an internet explorer,
firefly, fireknight, life is just right, look I am just me, simple, forget me now, leave me alone I made it, cold shoulder pads no sharks this week,
that verus is bullshit, i know look at it seriously messy pile of shit I have ever seen, relax someone will clean the screen, tap on there mic and feet,
no strawbeeries, nobody cares, nice i'll surive,
