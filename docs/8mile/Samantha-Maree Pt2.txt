Song Title - Samantha-Maree ( Limited Edition Pt 2 )

[Soldier intro beat] - 

Yo Left, Yo Left, Yo Left Right Left now look at that ocean while your at the beach fighting your issues, I love you darling,
there is not a single person in this universe that can beat your heartbeat, look at you smiling because you know I am telling the holy truth,
do you write with your right hand or are just like daddy using your wonderful left hand to show them that the skills come from those that are different,
yes ticky tock as you look at your watch daddy just brought you with a bunch of purple orchids, yes honey you can do it without me I know you can surive,
I am sorry I can not spell or be a better human in this race we are having with our hearts, am just simply sorry and I know that is never good enough, I love you,
yeah keep nodding your head as you go into that tunnel with your family and life, yes never drop that mic or never feel sorry for your father he just failed,
never look back, look up and thank god for giving you another life, 
I want you to do me another favour please keep listening to Skylar Gray and Justin Biebers? you will learn down the 8mile track in life we will met again,
via music toons, yeah tunes I know I did it on purpose so you can learn more then vanilla ice, laughing out loud I know L.O.L, look at you,
your seriously a goddess never let any fella tell you your worth, your worth is whatever you believe and well I believe that your worth a star,
a ocean, a life, a voice, a person, a love bird just like a mockingbird, keep your chin up, I love you,

Yeah I am sitting here trying to write another lullaby because I want you to know that I will do anything for you,
even fly around on a jetpack just see you smile or even laugh at Hilary Duff, Look on the internet or buy a dvd set of Lizzie Mcguire,
you will hopefully love it just as much as you love music and drama, never give up being whoever it is you want to be darling, be a nurse, be a doctor,
be yourself, just enjoy life as it is handed to you, look into that mirror find yourself, your mother or even myself, but if you fail just blame me honey, seriously,
never blame yourself I can not handle you crumbling down and drowning in that beautiful ocean you have created, yeah instead be a shark or flounder from the little mermaid,
yes I know your nodding your head because you finally found a beat for this wonderful verse you call a lullaby, that's right honey your as beautiful as Tigger and his friends,
tigger is bouncing around inside my head so I guess he will be doing the same for you if your nodding your head to this verse, words, curse, dinosaurs, rawr which means I love you,
trust me you can do anything if you strongly believe it in, look around what do you see? I see many things including yourself, 

Yeah on your swing set or your slip and slide running around looking for orchids for your mother, I honestly remember she loves them so buy them for her would you?,
say they are from your beautiful soul and play Jesse McCartney as you give 'em to her, tell her you love her and you would love to look into her eyes and see your life before you nod your head again,
yes that is right honey I love you and I strongly believe you can be anything, don't fight it just do it, dad is a drop kick, a sidekick, a loser without a beat, I wish you the best, seriously,
Samantha-Maree, keep that chin up!, now FreeStyle, now live your life, have friends, have emenies but remember your the boss of them,
they can not distroy you because they can never hurt a soldier, who strongly believes in themself, so stand up and tell 'em your gonna make them choke on every word they ate for breakfast, yes remix,
freestyle my darling and remember try to be a soldier they would admire, I know I will!. 

Kiss Kiss, 
Never forget,
I love you to pluto and back,
Love,
The Insane Father.
